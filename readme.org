#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS BLOCKED | DONE WONTDO
* DOpus
[[https://www.gpsoft.com.au/][Directory Opus]] is still alive, but I wanted to do something similar in a modern language.

** Design choices
- Nothing is ever allowed to block the ui thread.
- dlangui -> gtkd

** Thanks
- Thanks go out to the [[http://dlang.org/][dlang.org]] for an interesting language,
- to Vladim Lopatin for creating [[https://github.com/buggins/dlangui][dlangui]]
- for gtkd
- and to d's package manager [[http://code.dlang.org/][dub]], which I really enjoy

** Todo
*** TODO speedup insertion of elements ...
https://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/sample-codes/speed-up-insert-of-20000-rows-to-treeview-Part-2.php
the ui is responsitive, if the fs is slow. if its fast itlooks up (i
guess because the idle thread is not idle anymore) 

*** TODO unblock lister change of depth
*** TODO window layout
*** TODO send to destination
ctrl- ->
*** TODO proper shutdown (e.g. last lister window unregisters -> app quits)
*** TODO copy from one lister to another
*** TODO move from one lister to another
*** TODO enter command in prompt
*** TODO rename a file
*** TODO Filter listers
