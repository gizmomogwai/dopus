* DOpus
[[https://www.gpsoft.com.au/][Directory Opus]] is still alive, but I wanted to do something similar in a modern language.

** Design choices
- Nothing is ever allowed to block the ui thread.

** Thanks
- Thanks go out to the [[http://dlang.org/][dlang.org]] for an interesting language,
- to Vladim Lopatin for creating [[https://github.com/buggins/dlangui][dlangui]],
- and to d's package manager [[http://code.dlang.org/][dub]], which I really enjoy
